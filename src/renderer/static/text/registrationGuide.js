    sentences: ['On Zbay, your privacy and freedom do not depend on the promises of any company or organization.', 'Unlike Facebook, Twitter, Slack or even Signal, Zbay does not trust or depend on code run by someone else.', 'Zbay is “peer-to-peer” software, so there’s no big business lurking in the background, hoarding your data, and no central server for spy agencies to subpoena or hack.'

    sentences: [' Zbay is free and open source software, so independent researchers will be able to verify that Zbay does what it claims.',
      'Only you control the cryptographic keys to read your private messages.', 'If Zbay changes in an annoying or unethical way, any developer in the world can change Zbay’s code and publish a better version—and you could easily move your username, data, and messages to that new version.'

    sentences: ['Zbay is built on Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency founded by pioneers in cryptography and privacy protection. In turn, Zcash is based on Bitcoin, the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency.',
      'Zcash is a well-funded open source project with a world class team, stewarded by both a for-profit company and a non-profit foundation committed to making it as secure, fast, private and anonymous as possible.',

    sentences: ['To sync the Zcash blockchain, Zbay requires one big initial download (23GB). This takes about 2 to 3 hours.',
      'Zbay won\'t run in the background, so it won\'t slow your computer, and you can uninstall it at any time. The next time you run Zbay, connecting should take minutes.',
      '(Moving to the same room as your router will help, as will switching to a 5Ghz wifi network. In the future, we hope to make this step unnecessary, but for now we’re stuck with it—sorry!)'

      'This username gets engraved in the Zcash blockchain. It is forever yours and nobody can take it away.',

    title: 'Sending & receiving messages',
    sentences: ['Every direct message you send is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it.',
      'Unfortunately, messages can\'t be deleted, but deletion is tricky. Some apps with "disappearing" messages don\'t really delete them from servers, and it can be difficult for non-experts to *really* delete something.',

    sentences: ['Zbay has “channels”, group chats that can be either private or public.', 'Messages to a channel are still encrypted, but everyone who gets the key to the channel can see them.', 'Public channels have owners who can moderate messages. Nobody can delete messages, but channel owners can hide messages, for example to keep trolls from spoiling a functioning online community.'

      'With Bitcoin, third parties can see who paid who, but Zcash makes this much more difficult, if not impossible, protecting your privacy. Someday Zbay will have escrow payments with dispute resolution and seller ratings. Right now, channel owners can use moderation to keep out scam sellers.'
